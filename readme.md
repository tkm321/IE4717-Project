**Theme 3:**
**A web portal for online purchase of consumer electronics / IT products**

- You may choose the types of consumer electronics or IT products and accessories.
- Your web site should allow a potential customer to browse different categories of products and product details in the online shop, and allow the customer to purchase online.
- Upon finalizing orders, your web application needs to acknowledge the order and provide a means to update the customer on the status of the order, via email.

==============================================================================================

In all the above project themes, payment is assumed to be handled by a third-party portal
and you do not have to implement the redirection. You simply consider the actions to take
when the payment is successful or not successful.

After selecting the above project theme, work on a project title that best describes your
web application. Then, brainstorm the project scope and application requirements with
your project partner to design, develop and publish your web application as per project
guidelines given in the course.

**Guidelines on Web Application Design Project:**
- The web application design project aims to give you a hands-on practice of what you
learned from exercises and examples covered in the class. You are expected to design,
develop, and publish a web application proposed by you using recommended design
practices. Hence, your Project should demonstrate your hands-on experience of the web
application development lifecycle and concepts learned in this course.
- The project must be based on your own design and completed by you in a group of two
students (or a single student in case there is an odd number of students in the class group).
The use of free or purchased web site templates is not permitted. These include those
found in Dreamweaver, purchased or free, blog or social networking templates from the
Internet as well as the examples and case studies in textbooks.
- Also, you cannot re-use this design project as part of your Final Year Project or for any
other courses in which it is assessed.
- What is a "page" ? To be considered as a "page" in your project, a web document must
be consistent with your design and contain dynamic content for the target audience such
as text and images with respective styling and data validation where applicable. A web
page that has little or no dynamic content or consists only of a static image or a PDF will
NOT be counted as a "page".

**Project MUST contain at least:**
- One (1) home page and four(4) but no more than ten(10) additional content pages
  o Every page must contain appropriate text and images to convey the desired
  messages to the target audience
  o Every page must contain appropriate page titles
- One (1) table display content effectively
- One (1) form (four (4) fields minimum), together with server-side processing of form
data and transactions with database.
- Transactions with database must involve SQL commands such as Select, Insert,
Update.
- One (1) server-side generated web page.
- Data entries not validated by HTML5 should be validated by JavaScript except for
those which can only be validated by server-side scripts together with the database.
- Data entries not validated on client-side must be validated on the server-side using
PHP.
- Form must reside on project site (link to an external form is not allowed)
- One (1) external style sheet (CSS) file which contains a minimum of four (4) styles
should be found in the web folders

**Project must NOT contain:**
- Mailto or handlers as the FORM action. FORM action should invoke a php script.
- < FRAMES > based page layout
- < TABLE > based page layout
- < IFRAME > based page layout
- JQuery, JSON, AJAX, etc. which are not covered in this module
- Purely image-based page (where the page contains little or no text or content other
than images)
- Templates or features extracted from Flutter, Marvel, ReactJS, Dreamweaver,
Bootstrap, Foundation, GitHub, or any other web site development tools
- Links to Paypal, Facebook, Twitter Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo mail, etc. external web
sites

**Your project will be evaluated on the following criteria:**
- Application of Design Principles
- Accomplishment with respect to your design documents
- Visually Appealing
- Your mastery of web programming languages. 

**In the design project report, the following must be seen:**
- Application requirements 
- Functional Requirements 
- Site Map: it shows the overall web site structure 
- Storyboard: Using a word processor, PowerPoint, or ruler and pencil, draw a 
flowchart (storyboard) of your web site that shows the hierarchy of pages and 
relationships between the pages. 
- Wireframe: Use ruler and pencil or use a computer application to create a 
wireframe for a sample page on your web site that clearly shows the logo, 
navigation, content, and footer areas. Use a camera or use a graphics application 
to save a wireframe as a .gif or .jpg file.
- Implementation details: This section should describe how the web applications 
are implemented and coding techniques used. It should correspond to the design.
- Testing of web application: Test cases should be part of the design and these 
test cases must be presented with the test methods and test results. The tests 
should show that all the application requirements are met.
